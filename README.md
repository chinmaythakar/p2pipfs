# p2pipfs


## Use Case
- To show P2P distributed computing architecture on OCI. In a P2P network, the "peers" are computer systems which are connected to each other via the Internet. Files can be shared directly between systems on the network without the need of a central server. In other words, each computer on a P2P network becomes a file server as well as a client. In our case nodes are OCI compute Linux instances and the file transfer for the application is limited to images files.

### Pre-requisites
- You should have a cloud account with roles/policies to manage the entire tenancy. You should also have experience working with compute instances and basic networking in OCI.
